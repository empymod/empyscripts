**Note**: ``v0.3.2`` is the *last release* of ``empyscripts``. From ``empymod
v1.7.0`` onwards ``empyscripts`` is directly included in ``empymod`` as
``empymod.scripts``.

The **empyscripts** are *add-ons* for the electromagnetic modeller **empymod**.
These add-ons provide some very specific, additional functionalities:

- ``tmtemod``: Return up- and down-going TM/TE-mode contributions for
  x-directed electric sources and receivers, which are located in the same
  layer.
- ``fdesign``: Design digital linear filters for the Hankel and Fourier
  transforms.

There is also ``empyscripts.versions()``, which can be used to show date, time,
and package version information at the end of a notebook or script:

- ``versions('HTML')`` for Jupyter Notebooks, and
- ``versions()`` for IPython, QT, and Python consoles.

See https://empymod.github.io/#features for a complete list of features of
empymod.
