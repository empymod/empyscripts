This repo contains *add-ons* for ``empymod``. These are scripts that did not
make it into ``empymod``. Most likely because they require some sort of change
to the ``empymod`` core features, but are only for a very specific use cases.
Hence it was decided to not implement them in ``empymod``.

Please note that these add-ons are not as thoroughly tested as ``empymod``, and
potentially not as well documented either.
